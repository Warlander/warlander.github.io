lead_text: "In Lily's Garden, my main contribution so far is implementation of **Lily's Mysteries** event/game mode as part of content tools team. I also implemented and optimized tooling, notable improvements include: rewrite and redesign of content build and testing pipeline, bringing legacy user interface framework to modern code quality standards and taking advantage of said improvements to implement support for new and complex visual effects and animations to improve user engagement.

Lily's Garden is a huge project that requires cooperation between multiple developers in different teams, as well as with different roles such as UI designers, authors and artists. I'm also coordinating both in-person and remotely with people all over the world."
