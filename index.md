Hello! I'm **Maciej Cyranowicz** also better known online as **Warlander**. Game developer by passion and trade, gamer, maker and caretaker of guinea pigs.

Let's make games and push the limits of this art form together!

# My timeline

* My father introduced me to computers and video games at 5 years old, this quickly turned into interest on how games are made and how they work under the hood.
* I started making first simple video games using RPG Maker and GameMaker at 8 years old.
* Learned programming in Visual Basic and then Java at 14. At first, I used this newfound knowledge to create GUI tools for my favourite games, but as tools became increasingly complex and visual being restricted to GUI and simple graphics became a limitation. This made me learn OpenGL basics and making some simple graphics engines, such as the ones used in earlier iterations of my tool [**DeedPlanner**](https://github.com/Warlander/DeedPlanner-2) for Wurm Online. (and plenty of game prototypes, of course!)
* At 19 years old, I got an offer I couldn't refuse to volunteer on [**Wurm Online**](https://www.wurmonline.com) MMO project. This was my first experience with commercial project - my contributions include mainly quality of life and immersion features, additions and fixes. I also worked on internal tools, with main focus being terrain generation/editing and 3d model workflow tools.
* At 20 years old, I discovered and started using Unity. It would become my engine of choice replacing custom-made Java/OpenGL engines over the next few years.
* At 21 years old, I participated in release of [**Wurm Unlimited**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/366220/Wurm_Unlimited/) on Steam, engaging with the community, communicating with game publisher PlugInDigital, coordinating work on promotional materials, Steam page and the global release.
* At 24 years old, I started my professional game development journey at [**Ahoy Games**](https://www.ahoygames.com)!
* At 28 years old, I moved to Denmark where I'm currently working at [**Tactile Games**](https://tactilegames.com).
