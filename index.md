Hello! I'm **Maciej Cyranowicz** also better known online as **Warlander**. Game developer by passion and trade, gamer, maker, and caretaker of guinea pigs.

# My timeline

* My father introduced me to computers and video games at 5 years old, this quickly turned into interest on how games are made and how they work under the hood.
* I started making first simple video games using RPG Maker and GameMaker at 8 years old.
* Learned programming in Visual Basic and then Java at 14. At first, I used this newfound knowledge to create GUI tools for my favourite games, but as tools became increasingly complex and visual being restricted to GUI and simple graphics became a limitation. This made me learn OpenGL basics and making some simple graphics engines, such as the ones used in earlier iterations of my tool [**DeedPlanner**](https://github.com/Warlander/DeedPlanner-2) for Wurm Online. (and plenty of game prototypes, of course!)
* At 19 years old, I got an offer I couldn't refuse to volunteer on [**Wurm Online**](https://www.wurmonline.com) MMO project. This was my first experience with commercial project - my contributions include mainly quality of life and immersion features, additions and fixes. I also worked on internal tools, with main focus being terrain generation/editing and 3d model workflow tools.
* At 20 years old, I discovered and started using Unity. It would become my engine of choice replacing custom-made Java/OpenGL engines over the next few years.
* At 21 years old, I participated in release of [**Wurm Unlimited**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/366220/Wurm_Unlimited/) on Steam, engaging with the community, communicating with game publisher Plug In Digital, coordinating work on promotional materials, Steam page and the global release.
* At 24 years old, I started my professional game development journey at [**Ahoy Games**](https://www.ahoygames.com)!
* At 28 years old, I moved to Denmark where I'm currently working at [**Tactile Games**](https://tactilegames.com).

## Lily's Garden

In Lily's Garden, my main contribution so far is implementation of **Lily's Mysteries** event/game mode as part of content tools team. I also implemented and optimized tooling, notable improvements include: rewrite and redesign of content build and testing pipeline, bringing legacy user interface framework to modern code quality standards and taking advantage of said improvements to implement support for new and complex visual effects and animations to improve user engagement.

Lily's Garden is a huge project that requires cooperation between multiple developers in different teams, as well as with different roles such as UI designers, authors and artists. I'm also coordinating both in-person and remotely with people all over the world.

## Wurm Online

Greenfield project I led development on. I implemented all gameplay mechanics present in the game - most important being multiplayer support, gameplay loop, card handling system involving cards dynamically responding to player inputs, smoothly transitioning between states, being controlled by physics or predefined animations depending on circumstances. I coordinated closely with artists to bring their ideas to life, requiring both extensive problem solving and finding creative solutions for problems within Unity game engine.

## Okey

I took part in the development of multiplayer functionalities, social features and the cafe building mode. I also created automation tools streamlining the game testing process, and took part in porting the game from Haxe programming language to Unity game engine. This project presented many challenges, a lot of time was spent bringing it up to modern standards and implementing functionalities years after the original release such as multiplayer support.

## Wurm Unlimited

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/366220/Wurm_Unlimited/)

I took part of development of the game, improving the player experience and modernizing the game launcher. I also engaged with the community, communicated with the game publisher Plug In Digital, coordinated work on promotional materials, Steam page and the global release.

## Backgammon Legends

I took part in scaling the game up after the initial release - implementing new functionalities such as more customization options (custom dice and boards), and improving monetization.

## DeedPlanner
**Personal Project**

My personal pet project which I took from small learning project, all the way to tool used and loved by most of the Wurm Online game community - program allowing users to rapidly prototype homes and entire villages before they put days or weeks of work into them in Wurm Online/Wurm Unlimited game. It also offers many other helpful features, such as the warning system in case the designed structures are impossible to build in-game, and calculator allowing to determine how many materials the in-game project will take to build. This project and its different iterations is a good time capsule of my skills as a programmer increasing over time. The project went from very rudimentary early versions all the way to the third iteration of the program being a playground for programming patterns and Unity features, and together with that came more and higher quality features for its users.
