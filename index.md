Hello! I'm **Maciej Cyranowicz** also better known online as **Warlander**. Game developer by passion and trade, gamer, maker and caretaker of guinea pigs.

Let's make games and push the limits of this art form together!

# My timeline

* My father introduced me to computers and video games at 5 years old, this quickly turned into interest on how games are made and how they work under the hood.
* I started making first simple video games using RPG Maker and GameMaker at 8 years old.
* Learned programming in Visual Basic and then Java at 14. At first, I used this newfound knowledge to create GUI tools for my favourite games, but as tools became increasingly complex and visual being restricted to GUI and simple graphics became a limitation. This made me learn OpenGL basics and making some simple graphics engines, such as the ones used in earlier iterations of my tool [**DeedPlanner**](https://github.com/Warlander/DeedPlanner-2) for Wurm Online. (and plenty of game prototypes, of course!)
* At 19 years old, I got an offer I couldn't refuse to volunteer on [**Wurm Online**](https://www.wurmonline.com) MMO project. This was my first experience with commercial project - my contributions include mainly quality of life and immersion features, additions and fixes. I also worked on internal tools, with main focus being terrain generation/editing and 3d model workflow tools.
* At 20 years old, I discovered and started using Unity. It would become my engine of choice replacing custom-made Java/OpenGL engines over the next few years.
* At 21 years old, I participated in release of [**Wurm Unlimited**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/366220/Wurm_Unlimited/) on Steam, engaging with the community, communicating with game publisher PlugInDigital, coordinating work on promotional materials, Steam page and the global release.
* At 24 years old, I started my professional game development journey at [**Ahoy Games**](https://www.ahoygames.com)!
* At 28 years old, I moved to Denmark where I'm currently working at [**Tactile Games**](https://tactilegames.com).

* Improvement and optimization of tooling. Notable improvements include rewrite and redesign of content build and testing pipeline, bringing legacy user interface framework to modern code quality standards and taking advantage of said improvements to implement support for new and complex visual effects and animations to improve user engagement.
* Development of new game features and entire new game modes as a part of a Scrum team.
* Coordination with wide variety of different teams and roles within the company and its subsidiaries.
* Translation of stakeholders needs and scrum user stories into development tasks and their implementation.
* Biggest accomplishment: development of Lily's Mysteries feature which greatly boosted player engagement.
